# Introduction to a COVID-19 data exploration based on different industries 

This notebook specifically is designed to be a simple notebook that emphasizes and explains by the 
utilization of the COVID 19 data set and NASDAQ historical data the effect of Covid-19 on stock prices of the
three vaccine companies (Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and Pfizer) as well as some of the largest sectors in
the U.S (Energy, Tech, Consumer Staples, and Health)

We will focus on asking whether or not Covid-19 had a significant effect on the stock prices of these companies/sectors as well as seeing how the stock prices compare today to pre-pandemic.

Our initial thoughts are the following:
For the three vaccine companies, they will likely all increase in stock price throughout the pandemic era from 2020 to present day and will have shown the highest increase in stock price at the first major surge of Covid-19 Cases.

For the sectors: Energy will have an increase moderate increase in stock price due to the great majority of the population staying at home due to quarantine, however will also be tampered by the lack of transportation and office space used as well. Tech will have a large increase in stock price due to consumers needing new technology in their homes to account for a virtual era such as webcams, computers, microphones etc. Consumer Staples will show the largest increase in stock prices due to the quarantine and consumers needing to buy larger quantities of goods to avoid frequent trips outside. Finally, Health will show the second largest increase in stock prices as the main focus during the pandemic era was to find ways to test for Covid-19 and ways to immunize against it.

This notebook will also introduce the dataset of COVID 19 data exploration on of the statistics of daily time 
series summary tables which includes the confirmed people having COVID 19, deaths from COVID 19, and people being 
recovered showing recovery from COVID 19 details.

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Reading The Data

To read the data we need to provide the paths to the csv files that we will use. Specifically, we want:

* US Confirmed Cases Over Time - time_series_covid19_confirmed_US.csv

The paths below are relative; the "./" translates to current directory so if you are running this code you would want your file structure to look like this

* parent_dir
  * final_proj.rmd
  * data Directory
    * time_series_covid19_confirmed_US.csv
    
```{r, results='hide'}
path_US_confirmed <- "./data/time_series_covid19_confirmed_US.csv"

cases <- read.csv(path_US_confirmed)
head(cases)
```
### Filter Columns
Let's first filter the data to only include the relevant columns. The select command allows us to filter on select columns. Let's make a simplifying assumption that we are only concerned with data per state over time. For this we would need only the Province_State column and columns that start with the letter X (for dates).

```{r, results='hide'}
cases = cases %>% select("Province_State" | starts_with("X"))
head(cases)

```

### Group By State

Now that we have dropped all unnecessary features, the next issue is that we have multiple rows for each state. It makes sense that we should group these rows together based on Province_State and sum the values in each cell.

The group_by function groups a dataframe by a specific variable (in our case Province_State) and the summarize function aggregates all columns starting with an X.

```{r, results='hide'}
cases = cases %>% group_by(Province_State) %>% summarise(across(starts_with("X"), sum))
head(cases) #uncomment to see dataframe in RStudio

```

### Convert from running sum

The original data set provides a running sum of confirmed Covid cases in the US, i.e. it counts the total number of confirmed Covid cases up until the date recorded. I thought we would get better analysis by viewing the daily amount of recorded Covid cases for each day, which gives us a better idea of when Covid was at its worst.

```{r, results='hide'}
case_delta <- cases

for(i in 2:ncol(cases)) {       # for-loop over columns
  
  if(i > 3) {
    case_delta[ , i] = abs((cases[ , i] - cases[ , i-1]))
  }
}

head(case_delta)

```


Here, we take the sum of cases over each state so we have a total number of cases in the US for easier analysis.

```{r, results='hide'}
case_delta <- colSums(case_delta[,-1])

cases_vec <- as.numeric(case_delta)
cases_vec[1:100]
```

Now we convert the character strings of dates provided into Date objects such that they can by manipulated mathematically later.

```{r, results='hide'}
dates = names(case_delta)
dates = as.Date(dates, format="X%m.%d.%y")

head(dates)
```

We now have a decent plot for daily confirmed cases over the past two years.

```{r}
plot(dates, cases_vec, xlab="Time", ylab="Daily Confirmed Cases")
title("Daily Confirmed Covid Cases from 2020 to 2022")
```

Now that we have our Covid cases over time correctly charted, we must get some stock data to compare such that we can draw comparisons between daily cases and the values of certain stocks. 

## Reading The Data

To read the data we need to provide the paths to the csv files that we will use. Specifically, we want:

* Johnson & Johnson Stock Prices - historical_JNJ.csv
* Moderna Stock Prices - historical_MRNA.csv
* Pfizer Stock Prices - historical_PFE.csv
* Energy Select Sector Stock Prices - historical_XLE.csv
* Technology Select Sector Stock Prices - historical_XLK.csv
* Consumer Product Select Sector Stock Prices - historical_XLP.csv
* Health Care Select Sector Stock Prices - historical_XLK.csv

The paths below are relative; the "./" translates to current directory so if you are running this code you would want your file structure to look like this

* parent_dir
  * final_proj.rmd
  * data Directory
    * historical_JNJ.csv
    * historical_MRNA.csv
    * historical_PFE.csv
    * historical_XLE.csv
    * historical_XLK.csv
    * historical_XLP.csv
    * historical_XLV.csv
    
```{r, results='hide'}
path_jnj <- "./data/historical_JNJ.csv"
path_moderna <- "./data/historical_MRNA.csv"
path_pfizer <- "./data/historical_PFE.csv"
path_energy <- "./data/historical_XLE.csv"
path_tech <- "./data/historical_XLK.csv"
path_consumer <- "./data/historical_XLP.csv"
path_health <- "./data/historical_XLV.csv"

jnj <- read.csv(path_jnj)
moderna <- read.csv(path_moderna)
pfizer <- read.csv(path_pfizer)
energy <- read.csv(path_energy)
tech <- read.csv(path_tech)
consumer <- read.csv(path_consumer)
health <- read.csv(path_health)

head(health)
```

Here, we take the two important columns from our dataframe for analysis, being the date of the data point, and the opening stock price associated with that date.

```{r, results='hide'}
jnj = jnj %>% select("Date" | "Open")
jnj$Open <- parse_number(jnj$Open)

moderna = moderna %>% select("Date" | "Open")
moderna$Open <- parse_number(moderna$Open)

pfizer = pfizer %>% select("Date" | "Open")
pfizer$Open <- parse_number(pfizer$Open)

energy = energy %>% select("Date" | "Open")
tech = tech %>% select("Date" | "Open")
consumer = consumer %>% select("Date" | "Open")
health = health %>% select("Date" | "Open")

head(health)
```

Here, we convert our date strings inside of these dataframes into Date objects.

```{r, results='hide'}
jnj$Date <- as.Date(jnj$Date, format="%m/%d/%Y")
moderna$Date <- as.Date(moderna$Date, format="%m/%d/%Y")
pfizer$Date <- as.Date(pfizer$Date, format="%m/%d/%Y")
energy$Date <- as.Date(energy$Date, format="%m/%d/%Y")
tech$Date <- as.Date(tech$Date, format="%m/%d/%Y")
consumer$Date <- as.Date(consumer$Date, format="%m/%d/%Y")
health$Date <- as.Date(health$Date, format="%m/%d/%Y")

head(health)
```
```{r, results='hide'}
Cases <- c(cases_vec)
Date <- c(dates)

df <- data.frame(Date, Cases)
head(df)
```
We create a new dataframe that includes only COVID cases and their associated dates.

Now, we trim the data frames to only contain dates that are within the range of dates we are looking at for our Covid data.

```{r, results='hide'}
jnj = jnj %>% filter(jnj$Date %in% dates)
moderna = moderna %>% filter(moderna$Date %in% dates)
pfizer = pfizer %>% filter(pfizer$Date %in% dates)
energy = energy %>% filter(energy$Date %in% dates)
tech = tech %>% filter(tech$Date %in% dates)
consumer = consumer %>% filter(consumer$Date %in% dates)
health = health %>% filter(health$Date %in% dates)
df = df %>% filter(df$Date %in% energy$Date)
df = df %>% arrange(desc(df$Date))
head(df)
```
## Plotting our data


Finally, we plot all the data we've acquired so far together.

```{r}
plot(df$Date, df$Cases, xlab="Time", ylab="Daily Confirmed Cases")
title("Daily Confirmed Covid Cases from 2020 to 2022")
```
Before we start, here is the adjusted COVID case plot over time matched with the associated stock price dates (this is because stocks opening prices are measured only 5 days a week, while COVID data was originally taken for all 7 days).

We choose first to compare the stock prices of the three major vaccine companies throughout the course of Covid. We do this by plotting them together on the same graph with our confirmed cases data.

```{r}
plot(df$Date, df$Cases, xlab="Time", ylab="Daily Confirmed Cases", pch=16)
par(new=T)
plot(pfizer$Date, pfizer$Open, type='l', col='red3', axes=F, xlab=NA, ylab=NA)
mtext(side=4, line=2, text='Opening Stock Price ($USD)')
par(new=T)
plot(jnj$Date, jnj$Open, type='l', col='green1', axes=F, xlab=NA, ylab=NA)
par(new=T)
plot(moderna$Date, moderna$Open, type='l', col='blue1', axes=F, xlab=NA, ylab=NA)
axis(side=4)
legend("topleft", 
          legend=c("Daily Confirmed Cases", "Pfizer", "Johnson & Johnson", "Moderna"), 
          col=c("black", "red3", "green1", "blue1"), lty=c(0,1,1,1), pch=c(16, NA, NA, NA))
title("Vaccine Company Stock Prices (USD) and Confirmed Cases 2020-2022")

```

```{r}
plot(df$Date, df$Cases, xlab="Time", ylab="Daily Confirmed Cases", pch=16)
par(new=T)
plot(energy$Date, energy$Open, type='l', col='red3', axes=F, xlab=NA, ylab=NA)
mtext(side=4, line=2, text='Opening Stock Price ($USD)')
axis(side=4)
legend("topleft", 
          legend=c("Daily Confirmed Cases", "Energy Sector"), 
          col=c("black", "red3"), lty=c(0,1), pch=c(16, NA))
title("Energy Sector Stock Prices (USD) and Confirmed Cases 2020-2022")
```
```{r}
plot(df$Date, df$Cases, xlab="Time", ylab="Daily Confirmed Cases", pch=16)
par(new=T)
plot(tech$Date, tech$Open, type='l', col='red3', axes=F, xlab=NA, ylab=NA)
mtext(side=4, line=2, text='Opening Stock Price ($USD)')
axis(side=4)
legend("topleft", 
          legend=c("Daily Confirmed Cases", "Tech Sector"), 
          col=c("black", "red3"), lty=c(0,1), pch=c(16, NA))
title("Tech Sector Stock Prices (USD) and Confirmed Cases 2020-2022")
```
```{r}
plot(df$Date, df$Cases, xlab="Time", ylab="Daily Confirmed Cases", pch=16)
par(new=T)
plot(consumer$Date, consumer$Open, type='l', col='red3', axes=F, xlab=NA, ylab=NA)
mtext(side=4, line=2, text='Opening Stock Price ($USD)')
axis(side=4)
legend("topleft", 
          legend=c("Daily Confirmed Cases", "Consumer Staple Sector"), 
          col=c("black", "red3"), lty=c(0,1), pch=c(16, NA))
title("Consumer Staple Stock Prices (USD) and Confirmed Cases 2020-2022")
```
```{r}
plot(df$Date, df$Cases, xlab="Time", ylab="Daily Confirmed Cases", pch=16)
par(new=T)
plot(health$Date, health$Open, type='l', col='red3', axes=F, xlab=NA, ylab=NA)
mtext(side=4, line=2, text='Opening Stock Price ($USD)')
axis(side=4)
legend("topleft", 
          legend=c("Daily Confirmed Cases", "Health Sector"), 
          col=c("black", "red3"), lty=c(0,1), pch=c(16, NA))
title("Health Sector Stock Prices (USD) and Confirmed Cases 2020-2022")
```
Now we must turn the plots into something that is visually easier to make comparisons on, and view relationships between individual sectors and companies with COVID cases.

# Relationships

```{r}
cor(df$Cases, consumer$Open)
cor(df$Cases, energy$Open)
cor(df$Cases, health$Open)
cor(df$Cases, tech$Open)
cor(df$Cases, jnj$Open)
cor(df$Cases, moderna$Open)
cor(df$Cases, pfizer$Open)
```
We take correlation coefficients to measure the degree of association between two variables, in this case, COVID cases and its effect on a given sector or vaccine company.

Below are plots that represent these associations, in visual form. The red line indicates the line of best-fit, otherwise known as a regression line.

```{r}
plot(df$Cases, consumer$Open, xlab="COVID Cases", ylab="Consumer Staple Sector Stock Prices", pch=16)
abline(lm(consumer$Open~df$Cases), col = 'red')
title("COVID Cases on Consumer Staple Sector Stock Prices")
```

```{r}
plot(df$Cases, energy$Open, xlab="COVID Cases", ylab="Energy Sector Stock Prices", pch=16)
abline(lm(energy$Open~df$Cases), col = 'red')
title("COVID Cases on Energy Sector Stock Prices")
```

```{r}
plot(df$Cases, health$Open, xlab="COVID Cases", ylab="Health Sector Stock Prices", pch=16)
abline(lm(health$Open~df$Cases), col = 'red')
title("COVID Cases on Health Sector Stock Prices")
```

```{r}
plot(df$Cases, tech$Open, xlab="COVID Cases", ylab="Tech Sector Stock Prices", pch=16)
abline(lm(tech$Open~df$Cases), col = 'red')
title("COVID Cases on Tech Sector Stock Prices")
```

```{r}
plot(df$Cases, jnj$Open, xlab="COVID Cases", ylab="Johnson&Johnson Stock Prices", pch=16)
abline(lm(jnj$Open~df$Cases), col = 'red')
title("COVID Cases on Johnson&Johnson Stock Prices")
```

```{r}
plot(df$Cases, moderna$Open, xlab="COVID Cases", ylab="Moderna Stock Prices", pch=16)
abline(lm(moderna$Open~df$Cases), col = 'red')
title("COVID Cases on Moderna Stock Prices")
```

```{r}
plot(df$Cases, pfizer$Open, xlab="COVID Cases", ylab="Pfizer Stock Prices", pch=16)
abline(lm(pfizer$Open~df$Cases), col = 'red')
title("COVID Cases on Pfizer Stock Prices")
```

# Analysis

After plotting the datasets and analyzing variables against each other, it is clear that COVID has actually seemingly benefited some of the sectors chosen for the analysis. As indicated by some of the initial plots, most sectors and vaccine companies have risen in stock prices, and thus also in financial health and state, as COVID started to rise between the years 2020 and 2022. The nature of the COVID graph has 2 major spikes. The first is indicative of COVID's first major wave, which started hitting the hardest from the start of mid 2020 to the end of 2021, around when the vaccines began to release. The second spike can be attributed to the onset of the COVID Delta variant, which arrived to the US as soon as March, before becoming the most common form of identified COVID infection by June, at an estimated 82.2% of cases. While most of the vaccine companies and sectors have been facing an upward trend in terms of stock pricing, not all of it is in part due to the effects of COVID.

According to the results, it appears that the energy sector has incredibly weak association with COVID cases, which
means that it has practically no correlation. This can be identified by the red line plotted in its graph, the line of best fit, which shows a near 0 value for correlation. Besides this sector, the other sectors and the vaccines have a somewhat moderate positive correlation to COVID cases over time, as displayed by the general upwards trend not seen in the energy sector. This means that as COVID cases appear, stocks rise, which means that the sector or business is seeing financial growth. In particular for vaccines, it appears that Johnson&Johnson has the weakest correlation out of the three vaccine types, while Moderna is the strongest, though not by a drastic difference. 

# Conclusion

In analyzing the effects of COVID-19 on various sectors and industries, our study focused on the visual and correlative statistics applied in the plotting and analysis seen earlier. The reasoning behind the rise in vaccine company stocks is quite evident, likely due to the demand of the vaccines and the overall necessity of them in the time of the pandemic. The consumer, health, and tech sectors rose, though there are some things of interest to note. The consumer staple sector increasing with COVID is likely due to the fact that consumer goods like food and other products are more and more necessary, especially as people began to stay inside and go out less. The health sector is evidently increasing in stock price, as health services are extremely necessary as more people get sick. Interestingly enough, the tech sector still rose, despite having notable demand troubles with the silicon chip shortage the tech industry was facing in 2020 to 2021, which had negative effects on the computer industry, car industry, and even home appliances. This may be due to the fact that digital technologies, including things like software, social medias, and even AI, are still quite relevant, despite the struggles with meeting physical demands. A potential reason for why the energy sector's stock prices may not have any sort of change from rising COVID cases may be because of the fact that demand for energy may have stayed net-even, especially as demands fluctuate and lockdown conditions also fluctuate. However, it is important to note that out of energy types, oil demand dropped the most at the onset of the pandemic, especially due to travel and shipping halts, and the energy demand as a whole dropped nearly 4% in 2020, though it is unknown if this statistic has recovered over time. More research may need to be done in order to come to a reasonable conclusion on why the energy sector's stock prices barely budged. Drawing back to the hypotheses, it is to be noted that there is indeed, for the most part, a relationship in COVID cases with the change in stock prices of various sectors and companies analyzed in our research. In particular, most of the sectors and companies analyzed displayed a positive, linear relationship, meaning that chosen sectors and vaccine companies were seeing financial growth as COVID began to spread.
